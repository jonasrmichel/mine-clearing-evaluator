# mine-clearing-evaluator
This is a coding exercise that provides a program that simulates and scores the performance of a mine clearing script on a mine field. See `coding-exercise-swen.pdf` for information on the specifications and operation of the program.

The entry points of this program are the `Evaluator` and `TestEvaluator` classes. See both classes for instructions. You can either build and run the source or simply run one of the executable jars in the `runnables/` directory.
